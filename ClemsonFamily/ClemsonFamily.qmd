## Historical Context
In the pursuit of creating broad narratives and themes which account for large trends over long periods historians are often hard-pressed to spend significant time or publication space examining individual institutions or people. Increasingly, however, since the cultural and digital turns, personal narratives are often interjected into these larger narratives as a way to create more complete and inclusive histories. These inclusions provide human connections within larger themes of social, political and economic change. This project focuses not on intricate or biographical details of the lives that contributed to Clemson Agricultural College during the first half of the twentieth century, but rather on the connections between their lives. It is the beginning of an examination of the ubiquitous but rarely clearly defined notion of Clemson Family.

There exists a rich and varied tradition of publications about institutional histories in the historiography of higher education in the United States. Perhaps what sometimes falls through the cracks of historic scholarship are institutional histories done at a high, academic level. Some reasons for this gap are articulated by Joseph Amago in *Rethinking Home*.[^1] Regarding his and other historians' work with local and microhistories Amato observes that these works are often relegated to non-professional historians or historical societies because local histories fail to draw scholars because of the need for "commitment to the micro-landscapes in an era of macro focus". Amato calls for a new generation of historians to shed the need for systemization replaced by a commitment to particular histories and who "reject overarching explanations for microhistories, instead staying true to details, anecdotes, and peculiarities of place...they prefer case studies to academic theory".[^2]

The history of Clemson University has been written in many ways and for various purposes throughout the years. Jerry Reel, who has written what is perhaps the seminal history of Clemson University in the *High Seminary* volumes, follows the well-worn tradition of emeritus scholars writing about their institutional homes. Reel's careful examination of the Board of Trustees, presidents, football program highlights, and the development of the physical spaces of the university provides alumni and fans the opportunity to learn about the decisions and directions that created Clemson University as it exists today.[^3] While Dr. Reel has contributed to the telling of Clemson's history from a scholarly standpoint, a cursory glance at the majority of the published histories reveal that football and personal experiences as students still largely dominate the literature.[^4] While wonderful for fans and alumni, these book do little to position Clemson within the larger themes of southern, race, gender or other widely accepted scholarly themes. 

The confirmation of unmarked African American burials at Cemetery Hill in 2020 and the resulting publications by Dr. Rhondda Thomas have greatly expanded Clemson's history, especially in regards to race. Dr. Thomas' scholarly efforts in *Call My Name* and *Rhetoric, Public Memory, and Campus History* illuminate the entirety of Clemson's history reaching into is antebellum past as a plantation powered by unfree African American labor, through the postbellum construction of college buildings by black convicts leased to Clemson Agricultural College by the state of South Carolina.[^5]

What is perhaps still developing in the history of Clemson are the connections between the various communities represented on Cemetery Hill and in other ways throughout the university's history. There is an effort underway to begin to try and understand the interactions and influences of the various communities with and on one another. The beautiful new gate installed in April 2025 at the entrance of Cemetery Hill represents the current phase of the project and on-going research initiatives. Three ribbons wind their way through the bottom of the gates each symbolizing one of the three burial grounds at Cemetery Hill: the original Andrew P. Calhoun plot, the African American burial ground, and Woodland Cemetery. The ribbons symbolize the threads of narrative that occur so visibly at Cemetery Hill and point our research toward those hidden, forgotten or suppressed histories that so many historians have worked so hard to tell since the cultural turn.

By beginning to understand the social networks created among the faculty and officers who became Woodland plot assignees after the cemetery's creation in 1922 we can take another step in the research of understanding the ties that bind the Clemson Family to itself, who was excluded from those relationships, and how those networks functioned within and without the bounds of the university. 

## History of Woodland Cemetery

Woodland Cemetery, on the campus of Clemson University, was envisioned by President Walter Riggs in 1922 and the site of Cemetery Hill adjacent to the Calhoun plot approved by the Board of Trustees in 1923.[^6] Motivated in part by poor professor retention at Clemson Agricultural College, Riggs hoped to persuade officers and faculty of the school to remain by offering free plots and burials for them and their families.

The growth of Clemson after the American Great Depression of the 1920's through the 1950s as evidenced by the building of Memorial Stadium directly adjacent to Cemetery Hill and numerous other academic, agricultural and administrative buildings across campus directly corresponds to period in which the family plot assignments and burials in the oldest part of Woodland Cemetery begin to occur.[^7] It was also during this time that the notion of Clemson Family begins to rise in popularity among students, alumni and the local press.[^8] 

In order to explore the notion of Clemson Family, examining its existence and formation as a network of social currency, the network will be based on the earliest families buried in Woodland and those who lived in campus housing. 

![1943 Clemson University Atlas](images/1943%20Atlas%20(1).jpg)

The following family names appear on the 1943 Clemson University Atlas provided to me by Rick Owens, Clemson's preservation officer:

- Henry
- Watkins
- Littlejohn
- Dargin
- Cook
- Cody
- Feely
- Bradley
- Neely
- Milford
- Bryan
- Lemaster
- Aull
- Hunter
- Earle
- Littlejohn
- McCollum
- Trively
- Anderson
- Burley
- Elmore
- Musser
- Cureton
- Rosencran
- Brock
- Harcombe
- Lindsay
- Carey
- Marshall
- Sharpe
- *Sirrine
- *Riggs
- *Tillman
- *Long

- *University buildings (not occupied by families)

The 1943 Atlas provided some notion of the correlation between families that lived in university housing and those who chose to be buried at Woodland, but on April 14th, 2025 Mr. Ownes found a map of Clemson drawn by W.M. Simpson and J.R. Cooper believed to have been created in 1936. The key to the map listed over 200 names of individuals living on campus. This map along with the Clemson Record, Catalog and Announcements for the 1936-1937 academic year are the foundational documents for this project and dataset.[^9] According to Mr. Owens, the reason for the large discrepancy between the number of names listed on the 1943 map and the 1936 atlas is that the map was printed in Taps and shows only partial map of main campus.


## Layers of Connections

The dataset for this project began by documenting people that lived in campus housing as evidenced either by the 1936 map or the 1943 atlas. The dataset was then expanded by recording the people that are recorded in the 1936-37 Clemson Record, Catalog and Announcements. The Record provides detailed information about the officers, faculty and other members of Clemson's staff such as which department or office employed them, and where they received their undergraduate and graduate degrees.  

Because it is difficult to find the same amount and type of information for each group of people, not every record is as completely populated as it would be in an ideal project. This is especially true for faculty and other university employees that are not buried in Woodland. Because it then becomes necessary to discover where they went, if they left Clemson, and their burial location in order to locate their obituary or other documents that would provide the same information about their social and civil engagement during their time at Clemson. This would require research beyond the scope of this project.

Each employee that appears on the 1936 Clemson Map key is connected by their proximity to one another. To live and work with the same group of people heavily shaped their day-to-day lives and interactions with one another. The differentiation becomes in what area they worked.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

  #facet_nodes(~DepartmentPrimary) #group nodes by department
```


While this is a visually noisy graph because it is fully connected, it represents the weight of the connectedness of the lives of Clemson employees who also lived on campus. To further examine the layers of connections between individuals it is helpful to examine the institutions where they received their degrees before coming to Clemson.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Create a bar graph illustrating number of degrees received by Clemson faculty (ungrouped by degree type)
degree_institutions <- ClemsonFamilyData %>%
  select(UndergraduateInstitution, MastersInstitution, PhDInstitution) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "DegreeLevel", values_to = "Institution") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Institution) & Institution != "") %>%
  mutate(Institution = str_trim(Institution))

#count how many times each institution appears
institution_counts <- degree_institutions %>%
  group_by(Institution) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

ggplot(institution_counts, aes(x = reorder(Institution, Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Counts of Institutions Where Degrees Were Received",
       x = "Institution",
       y = "Number of Individuals") +
  theme_minimal()

```


It is no surprise that so many of the employees received degrees from Clemson. To further illustrate these connections further, however, it is helpful to see what levels of degrees came from which institutions:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Create a bar graph illustrating number of degrees received by Clemson faculty (grouped by degree type)
degree_data <- ClemsonFamilyData %>%
  select(UndergraduateInstitution, MastersInstitution, PhDInstitution) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),

        values_to = "Institution") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Institution) & Institution != "") %>%
  mutate(
    Institution = str_trim(Institution),
    DegreeLevel = recode(DegreeLevel,
                         UndergraduateInstitution = "Undergraduate",
                         MastersInstitution = "Masters",
                         PhDInstitution = "PhD"),
    DegreeLevel = factor(DegreeLevel, levels = c("Undergraduate", "Masters", "PhD"))
  )

#count institutions in each degree level
institution_counts_by_level <- degree_data %>%
  group_by(DegreeLevel, Institution) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop")

#order institutions number of degrees received
institution_counts_by_level <- institution_counts_by_level %>%

  ) +

  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

To understand the value of a Clemson degree for the men that would become members of the faculty and staff the two preceding visualizations must work in tandem. While those who were deans without Clemson degrees outnumber those with Clemson degrees, at this time Clemson was only awarding bachelor's degrees.[^10] There may be multiple reasons that Clemson graduates were rising to higher ranks in the school namely, the focus on local agriculture as well as the military training. Possibly, the men coming into faculty and staff positions were more quickly adaptable to the systems and structure of Clemson Agricultural College. Although this would begin to change under the presidency of E. Walter Sikes, the tendency to hire and promote Clemson men over their colleges with degrees, and sometimes more advanced degrees, is a strong influencer in the Clemson Family network during this period.[^11]

To begin to extract more information from the housing network, clusters around each department show the number of faculty and staff, about which professional information was available, working in each separate department. Triangle nodes indicate departments while circles indicate people.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

#select column and filter nodes list to create edges list
nodes_list <- read.csv("ClemsonFamily_files/files/ClemsonFamilyNodesListVer4.csv") 
edges_list <- nodes_list %>%
    select(ID, ClemsonDepartment) %>%
    filter(!is.na(ClemsonDepartment) & ClemsonDepartment != "")

#transform edges_list into a data.frame
edges_list <- as.data.frame(edges_list)

#str(edges_list)

#filter nodes list
filtered_nodes_list <- nodes_list %>%
    filter(!is.na(ClemsonDepartment) & ClemsonDepartment != "")

filtered_nodes_list <- as.data.frame(filtered_nodes_list)

#str(filtered_nodes_list)

nodes <- filtered_nodes_list %>%
    rename(id = ID) %>%
    mutate(label = id)

edges <- edges_list %>%
  rename(from = ID, to = ClemsonDepartment)

# Check for missing `from` IDs
#missing_from <- setdiff(edges$from, nodes$id)
#print(missing_from)

# Check for missing `to` IDs
#missing_to <- setdiff(edges$to, nodes$id)
#print(missing_to)

missing_nodes <- setdiff(unique(c(edges$from, edges$to)), nodes$id)
#print(missing_nodes)


if (length(missing_nodes) > 0) {
  # Create a data frame for missing nodes
  missing_nodes_df <- data.frame(id = missing_nodes, label = missing_nodes)
  
  # Add a 'type' column with "department" for all rows
  missing_nodes_df <- missing_nodes_df %>%
    mutate(type = "department")
  
  # Bind the missing nodes to the existing nodes
  nodes <- bind_rows(nodes, missing_nodes_df)
}

#print(nodes)

nodes <- nodes %>%
  mutate(shape = 
    if_else(type == "department", "triangle", "dot")
  ) #adds shape column and assigns triangles to type "department"

visNetwork(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, height = "650px", width = "1100px") %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr", randomSeed = 12) %>%
  visNodes(size = 36, 
           font = list(size = 20)) %>%
  visEdges(color = list(color = "gray", opacity = 0.5),
           hoverWidth = 20,
           selectionWidth = 36)
```

To further view their connectedness the additional variable of campus housing is added. The nodes representing people living on campus are orange, while the others are blue.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Modify the department visualization to show which people lived in campus housing
nodes_list <- read.csv("ClemsonFamily_files/files/ClemsonFamilyNodesListVer4.csv") 
edges_list <- nodes_list %>%
    select(ID, ClemsonDepartment) %>%
    filter(!is.na(ClemsonDepartment) & ClemsonDepartment != "")

    filtered_nodes_list <- nodes_list %>%
    filter(!is.na(ClemsonDepartment) & ClemsonDepartment != "")

filtered_nodes_list <- as.data.frame(filtered_nodes_list)

#str(housing_filtered_nodes_list)

nodes <- filtered_nodes_list %>%
    rename(id = ID) %>%
    mutate(label = id)

edges <- edges_list %>%
  rename(from = ID, to = ClemsonDepartment)

# Check for missing `from` IDs
#missing_from <- setdiff(edges$from, nodes$id)
#print(missing_from)

# Check for missing `to` IDs
#missing_to <- setdiff(edges$to, nodes$id)
#print(missing_to)

missing_nodes <- setdiff(unique(c(edges$from, edges$to)), nodes$id)
#print(missing_nodes)


if (length(missing_nodes) > 0) {
  # Create a data frame for missing nodes
  missing_nodes_df <- data.frame(id = missing_nodes, label = missing_nodes)
  
  # Add a 'type' column with "department" for all rows
  missing_nodes_df <- missing_nodes_df %>%
    mutate(type = "department")
  
  # Bind the missing nodes to the existing nodes
  nodes <- bind_rows(nodes, missing_nodes_df)
}

#print(nodes)

nodes <- nodes %>%
  mutate(shape = if_else(type == "department", "triangle", "dot"))

  nodes <- nodes %>%
  mutate(color = if_else(ClemsonHousing == TRUE, "orange", "blue")) # Assign colors based on ClemsonHousing #adds shape column and assigns triangles to type "department"

visNetwork(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, height = "650px", width = "1100px") %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr", randomSeed = 12) %>%
  visNodes(size = 36, 
           font = list(size = 20)) %>%
  visEdges(color = list(color = "gray", opacity = 0.5),
           hoverWidth = 20,
           selectionWidth = 36)
```

The final stage of the visualization indicates people buried at Woodland Cemetery by changing the shape of their representative nodes to a star. By adding this variable, change over time becomes visible. For the people who appear in the 1936 Record book as employees, there is often a lapse of 40 - 50 years before their death and internment in Woodland. This life-long commitment to Clemson is a key component of Clemson Family.

## Analysis

The size of each department is indicative of the academic focus of the school during this period. 

![1936 Record Book: Number of Students Majoring in Each Curriculum](images/CAC1936Enrollment.jpeg)

The greatest number of students according to the 1936 Record book were majoring in "Engineering Unclas [Unclassified]" with the next highest number majoring in Agriculture. The likely reason for the greater number of professors in the Agriculture Department can be accounted for by my decision to classify certain professors as a part of "General Education" when their subject matter seems likely to have been taught across multiple disciplines. For example, a professor of mathematics could have taught in the School of Engineering, but may have also taught in the School of General Science or Architecture. It may be possible to further refine these classifications by examining each individual, or proceeding through the Record, Catalog and Announcement book to discover if certain professors are directly connected to a specific school.

The addition of colors indicating whether an employee lived in campus housing begins to frame the concept of Clemson Family more discretely. That none of the members of the Board of Trustees or the Alumni Corporation Board of Directors lived in campus housing makes logical sense. As is the case today, the BOT and the Clemson Alumni Association Board of Directors serve as external bodies of the university. They are typically residents of South Carolina, but rarely live in Clemson and almost always hold jobs outside of the university. These entities, therefore, hold a unique role within the Clemson Family.

Perhaps the most interesting cluster revolves around "Other Officers". These individuals are unique in several ways, chiefly because of the percentage of females listed. Also listed are the five campus religious leaders: John K. Goode, Baptist; Donald E. Veale, Episcopla; Sydney J. L. crouch, Presbyterian; Herbert Otto Chambers, Methodist; and Henry L. Spiesman, Catholic.[^12]

The most compelling evidence of the formation of Clemson Family and the centrality of Woodland Cemetery to its cohesion is the final visualization which indicates with stars the individuals that chose to be buried in the cemetery. The overwhelming number of stars are orange, meaning that these people had been residents in campus housing while working as faculty and staff in the mid-1930s. To contextualize this in individual lives consider that most of these people were interred in the cemetery between the 1950's and 1970's. Dr. Joseph Lindsay, who is listed in the 1936 Record died and was buried at Woodland in 1998. These men and women and their families spent their entire lives on the grounds of Clemson Agricultural College and then chose those same grounds as their eternal resting place.

The tight interwovenness of these lives is visually evident by examining these networks. Men who shared classroom podiums, also shared backyard fences and now lie within yards or even feet of one another. Clemson Family became a physical reality when Walter Riggs conceived of a shared burial ground for those members of the faculty and staff who chose to stay and serve at Clemson for the remainder of their careers.


## For Further Research

Other layers of connectedness could be explored, such as individual's involvement in religious, social and civic organizations. The visualization below shows people clustered around the churches of which they were members.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Create edges list based on church affiliation
church_nodes_list <- read.csv("ClemsonFamily_files/files/ClemsonFamilyNodesListVer4.csv") 
church_edges_list <- church_nodes_list %>%
    select(ID, ChurchMembership) %>%
    filter(!is.na(ChurchMembership) & ChurchMembership != "")

#transform edges_list into a data.frame
church_edges_list <- as.data.frame(church_edges_list)

#str(church_edges_list)

#filter nodes list
church_filtered_nodes_list <- church_nodes_list %>%
    filter(!is.na(ChurchMembership) & ChurchMembership != "")

church_filtered_nodes_list <- as.data.frame(church_filtered_nodes_list)

#str(church_filtered_nodes_list)

church_nodes <- church_filtered_nodes_list %>%
    rename(id = ID) %>%
    mutate(label = id)

church_edges <- church_edges_list %>%
  rename(from = ID, to = ChurchMembership)

# Check for missing `from` IDs
church_missing_from <- setdiff(church_edges$from, church_nodes$id)
#print(church_missing_from)

# Check for missing `to` IDs
church_missing_to <- setdiff(church_edges$to, church_nodes$id)
#print(church_missing_to)


church_missing_nodes <- setdiff(unique(c(church_edges$from, church_edges$to)), church_nodes$id)
#print(missing_nodes)


if (length(church_missing_nodes) > 0) {
  # Create a data frame for missing nodes
  church_missing_nodes_df <- data.frame(id = church_missing_nodes, label = church_missing_nodes)
  
  # Add a 'type' column with "department" for all rows
  church_missing_nodes_df <- church_missing_nodes_df %>%
    mutate(type = "church")
  
  # Bind the missing nodes to the existing nodes
  church_nodes <- bind_rows(church_nodes, church_missing_nodes_df)
}

#print(church_nodes)


church_nodes <- church_nodes %>%
  mutate(shape = if_else(type == "church", "diamond", "dot")) #adds shape column and assigns a diamond to type "church"

visNetwork(nodes = church_nodes, edges = church_edges, height = "650px", width = "1100px") %>%
  visIgraphLayout(layout = "layout_with_fr", randomSeed = 12) %>%
  visNodes(size = 36, 
           font = list(size = 20)) %>%
  visEdges(color = list(color = "gray", opacity = 0.5),
           hoverWidth = 20,
           selectionWidth = 36)
```

Because the dataset is not as completely populated with church data as compared to university departments, it is less reliable. However, based on known trends that exist even into the present day, more than likely the graph above would simply increase in size, but the existing trend of the majority of connections existing within the Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist churches would persist.[^13]

Creating a network model which includes every person buried at Woodland Cemetery would be incredibly useful for the research at Cemetery Hill. Most likely, a temporal network is needed because of the length of time the cemetery has been in operation. The other key connection that this study did not consider is the family connections at Woodland. Spouse, sibling and in-law relationships are important, but what would be perhaps even more telling in understanding the development of Clemson Family, are children and extended family members that married other Clemson faculty children. Those generational trends would serve as key points of connection in the preservation and expansion of the notion of Clemson Family.

Beyond network mapping Woodland Cemetery, there are hundreds of additional names listed in the 1936-37 Clemson Record, Catalog and Announcements to say nothing of the previous and subsequent years of that and other Clemson publications. Mapping those who fall outside of the campus housing and Woodland Cemetery categories would also reveal an entirely different aspect of what constitutes Clemson Family. 

Others who would have been excluded from the Clemson Family, at least through the integration of Clemson University in 1963 with the admission of Harvey Gantt, would be black employees. There remains some record of their involvement in the 1936-37 Record book, but discovering additional names as well as their religious, civic and social affiliations would help uncover the complex and inequitable community and racial networks that operated at Clemson Agricultural College, in the broader Clemson community and across South Carolina during this era.

In the spirit of Dr. Thomas' "Call My Name" project, I've listed below the names of the black Agricultural Agents and Home Demonstration Agents as they appear in the 1936-37 Record, Catalog and Announcement book:

#### Agricultural Agents
- H. E. Daniels, District Agent, State College, Orangeburg

- Wm. Thompson, Clarendon
- H. C. Miller, Colleton
- H. S. Person, Florence
- Booker T. Miller, Greenville
- L. V. Walker, Greenwood
- G. W. Daniels, Orangeburg
- J. E. Dickson, Richland
- W. C. Bunch, Spartanburg
- Jason Maloney, Sumter
- E. N. Williams, Union
- Van Buren Thomas, Williamsburg

### Home Demonstration Agents
- Marian B. Paul, State Supervisor, State College, Orangeburg
- Matred McKissick, Aiken
- Rosa B. Reed, Allendale
- Willie Mabel Price, Beaufort
- Albertha DeVeaux, Charleston

## Conclusion

The notion of Clemson Family as it exists today is comprised of generations of alumni, athletics fans and other people associated with Clemson University. By building a network of most of the original faculty and officers who were assigned plots at Woodland Cemetery and were subsequently buried there, the strands of these early connections begin to be visible. By continuing this research, the lives which are less documented, such as the wives of faculty members, will be given weight within the connectedness of the Clemson Family. The eventual goal of mapping the networks of those whose strands were lightly connected or entirely disconnected to Clemson University in an official way, whether by their own choice or the dictates of others, will also illuminate the functionality of this network. Clemson Family traces part of its origin back to President Riggs and his conception of Woodland Cemetery and has grown to encompass thousands of people across the globe. Network analysis allows a tangible visualization of the expansion and exclusions of this important social function within the university.

[^8]: Beginning the late 1920's there is a rise in newspaper articles that refer to the "Clemson Family" in a context apart from the Thomas Green Clemson family. Some examples include a 1946 article reporting on the number of veterans returning to Clemson the prediction that diapers will soon "flutter with Clemson family wash" and a 1848 article that refers to an "official member of the Clemson family" who was displeased with the local press' reporting of the Clemson football team over Wake Forest. The article later describes this person as a Clemson booster.

[^12]: *Record*, 18. Eleven of the twenty-nine individuals listed as "Other Officers" are female. As far as I am able to tell, only one of the females was the wife of a Clemson employee. The rest were single, but sometimes daughters of Clemson faculty members. This is a noteworthy line of research that should be followed and has the potential to unlock a very unique aspect of Clemson Family.
