title: "Clemson Family"
---

Woodland Cemetery, on the campus of Clemson University, was created by President Walter Riggs in 1922. Motivated in part by poor professor retention at Clemson Agricultural College, Riggs devised a plan to use land adjacent to the historic Calhoun family burial plot as a faculty and officer cemetery and their families.

The growth of Clemson through the 1950s as evidenced by the building of Memorial Stadium directly adjacent to "Cemetery Hill" and numerous other academic, agricultural and administrative buildings across campus directly corresponds to the family plot assignments and burials in the oldest part of Woodland Cemetery. It was also during this time that the notion of the Clemson family begins to rise in popularity among students, alumni and the local press. 

In order to explore the notion of Clemson Family, examining its existance and formation as a network of social currency, the eariest families buried in Woodland will be compared to those who lived in campus housing.

The 1943 Atlas provided some notion of the correlation between families that lived in university housing and those who chose to be buried at Woodland, but on April 14th Rick Owens, Clemson's preservation officer, found a map of Clemson created by W.M. Simpson and J.R. Cooper believed to have been created in 1936. The key to the map listed over 200 names of individuals living on campus. This map became the central focus for this project and dataset.
