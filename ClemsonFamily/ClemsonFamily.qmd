title: "Clemson Family"

In the pursuit of creating broad narratives and themes which account for large trends over long periods historians are often hard-pressed to spend time examining individual institutions or people. Increasingly, however, since the cultural digital turns personal narratives are often interjected into these larger narratives as a way to incorporate "bottom up" histories. 

Perhaps what sometimes falls through the cracks of historic scholarship are institutional histories done at a high, academic level. The reasons for this gap is expressed by Joseph Amago in *Rethinking Home* regarding his an other historians work with local histories. Often relagate to non-professional historians or historical societies, local histories fail to draw scholars because of the need for "commitment to the micro-landscapes in an era of macro foces" (Amato, 187). Amato calls for a new generation of historians who shed the need for systemization for a commitment to particular histories and who "reject overarching explantions for microhistories, instead staying tru to details, anecdotes, and peculiarities of place...they prefer case studies to academic theory". 

The history of Clemson has been written in many ways and for various purposes throughout the years. Jerry Reel who has perhaps written the seminal history of Clemson University in the *High Seminary* volumes ...While the univeristy's history has been approached from a scholarly standpoint, a cursory glance at the majority of the published histories reveal that football and personal experiences as students dominate the literature. While wonderful for fans and alumni, these book do little to position Clemson within the larger themes of southern, race, gender or other widely accepted themes of scholarship. The confirmation of unmarked African American burials at Cemetery Hill in 2020 and the resulting publications by Dr. Rhondda Thomas have greatly expanded Clemson's history, especially in regards to race.

What is perhaps still developing in the history of Clemson are the connections between the various communities. The beautiful new gate installed at the entrance of Cemetery Hill represents the current phase of the project and on-going research initatives. Three ribbons wind their way through the bottom of the gates symbolizing each of the three burial grounds at Cemetery Hill: the original Andrew P. Calhoun plot, the African American burial ground, and Woodland Cemetery. The ribbons symbolize the threads of narrative that occur so visably at Cemetery Hill and that so many historians have worked so hard to tell since the cultural turn.

By beginning to understand the social networks created among the faculty and officers who became Woodland plot assignees after the cemetery's creation in 1922 we can take another step in the research of understanding the ties that bind Clemson family to itself and how those networks functioned beyond the university. 

Woodland Cemetery, on the campus of Clemson University, was created by President Walter Riggs in 1922. Motivated in part by poor professor retention at Clemson Agricultural College, Riggs devised a plan to use land adjacent to the historic Calhoun family burial plot as a faculty and officer cemetery and their families.

The growth of Clemson through the 1950s as evidenced by the building of Memorial Stadium directly adjacent to "Cemetery Hill" and numerous other academic, agricultural and administrative buildings across campus directly corresponds to the family plot assignments and burials in the oldest part of Woodland Cemetery. It was also during this time that the notion of the Clemson family begins to rise in popularity among students, alumni and the local press. 

In order to explore the notion of Clemson Family, examining its existance and formation as a network of social currency, the eariest families buried in Woodland will be compared to those who lived in campus housing.

The 1943 Atlas provided some notion of the correlation between families that lived in university housing and those who chose to be buried at Woodland, but on April 14th Rick Owens, Clemson's preservation officer, found a map of Clemson created by W.M. Simpson and J.R. Cooper believed to have been created in 1936. The key to the map listed over 200 names of individuals living on campus. This map became the central focus for this project and dataset.
